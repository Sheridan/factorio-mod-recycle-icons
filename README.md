Recycle icons for Factorio as signals and rich text icons

This mod adds recycling icons to signals, rich text, map labels and so on. It is designed to recognize all recycling recipes, including those that may be added by other mods in the future. If you encounter any recipes that are not recognized, please let me know so I can improve the mod's compatibility.
